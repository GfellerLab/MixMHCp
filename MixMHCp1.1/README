# New features of the version 1.1
############

Up to 20 modified or non-natural amino acids are allowed. Please use small letters 'acdefghiklmnpqrstvwy'.
If you use this option, please indicate the complete alphabet after the -a option in the command line.

############

MixMHCp is to be run from the terminal (command-line) on Mac and Linux. It requires perl, java and C++ scripts to run on your machine.

- Installing MixMHCp:

1) Create a directory where to install MixMHCp. Please avoid blank space or non-canonical characters in your path. 

2) Decompress MixMHCp1.1.tar.gz in this directory.

3) Open MixMHCp file with a text editor (e.g., emacs) and replace resources_location=YOUR_PATH by the location of the MixMHCp1.1/lib directory.

4) Put the MixMHCp executable in your PATH.


- Running MixMHCp:

MixMHCp -i INPUT_FILE -o OUTPUT_DIR -m MAX_MOTIF
Example: MixMHCp -i input.fa -o output -m 6

MixMHCp requires as input fasta files with all peptides of the same length, no gaps and only amino acids.
You can also use txt files with peptide sequences (lines starting with '>' are simply not considered).
Make sure your input file and paths names do not contain blank spaces or weird characters.
Make sure your input files are text files and do not include any rich formatting (e.g., save Excel files as .txt files).

- Test MixMHCp:

Make sure you are in the MixMHCp1.1 directory.
Run the command: ./MixMHCp -i test/test.fa -o test/out -m 6
Apart from path names, your output should be similar to what you have in test/out_compare directory
The test file represents HLA-I ligands identified in Bassani-Sternberg et al. MCP 2015 for HCC1143 sample.

1) The predicted number of motifs is given in KLD/best_ncl.txt. In addition, we also provide the KLD score in KLD/KLD.txt, as defined in Andreatta et al. Bioinformatics 2013. However, the optimal number of motifs does not necesseraly correspond to the maximal KLD score.

2) MixMHCp should only be applied on pre-aligned peptides and so far does not include any alignment step.

3) The responsibility values provide information of how much each peptide contributes to each motif. These values can then be used to cluster the peptides and the users can choose different threshold (e.g., any number, or the maximal value).

4) By default, the logos are plotted with the LoLa software, that is included in the package (http://baderlab.org/Software/LOLA). To plot logos with Seq2Logo (Martin Christen Frolund Thomsen; Morten Nielsen, Nucleic Acids Research 2012; 40 (W1): W281-W287), you need to have the proper license (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/biotools/Seq2Logo/) and have Seq2Logo in your path and add in the command line '-lt Seq2Logo'. You also need 'gs' (Ghostscript) to work on your machine.

5) If you use Seq2Logo to generate the logos, be aware that the logos do not include any random count or background frequency corrections. This is ideal to explore what is in your data, but may not exactly correspond to the motifs used to build predictors.

6) The PWMs provided as output correspond to those optimally describing the data. They do not necessarily correspond to the best predictors, since they do not incorporate any renormalization by the background frequencies and are build with a relatively low random count. In general, for making predictions, it is better to train a predictor based on the peptides themselves (for instance by clustering the peptides based on the responsibility values).

7) The optimal number of motifs predicted by the algorithm (Bassani-Sternberg et al. JI 2016) is given in KLD/best_ncl.txt file. However, in many cases it is worth going manually through the results of the motif deconvolution for different number of motifs, since motifs supported by less data (e.g., HLA-C alleles in HLA peptidomics) are more difficult to detect. Importantly, determining the optimal number of motifs is a known limitation of any clustering algorithm and often requires manual checking of the results.

8) Some users reported a bug with El Capitan when calling java from the terminal. The recommanded fix can be found for instance here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34201990/unsupported-major-minor-version-on-mac-os-x-el-capitan/34201991#34201991. Alternatively you may use the Seq2Logo option.

9) Expanded amino acid alphabet can be provided with the -a option (e.g. -a ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWYsty for phospho peptides). This allows you to use small letters for modified or non-natural amino acids. Make sure that all characters used in your input sequences are listed in the alphabet (this will determine the size of the alphabet considered by the model). By default, the 20 amino acids 'ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY' are assumed.
